In the telecommunications industry, predicting and managing customer churn is crucial for enhancing customer retention strategies. This project focused on building a predictive model using the "Orange Telecom Customer Churn Dataset" from Kaggle to forecast customer attrition accurately. This capability empowers telecom firms to proactively address potential churn and implement targeted retention strategies.

The project began with a comprehensive analysis of the dataset, encompassing customer demographics, usage patterns, service plans, and interaction history. Insights from discussions with an Orange employee enriched our understanding of customer behavior and churn mitigation tactics.

Key steps included rigorous data cleaning and preprocessing to ensure data integrity by handling missing values. Feature selection techniques were employed to identify pivotal predictors of churn, essential for enhancing model performance and reducing data complexity.

Several machine learning algorithms—logistic regression, decision trees, random forests, and gradient boosting machines—were evaluated. Each model underwent rigorous cross-validation to ensure robustness and reliability. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score were utilized to gauge model effectiveness.

The final model demonstrated impressive performance, achieving an accuracy of 96%, with precision, recall, and F1-scores of 95%, 94%, and 94.5%, respectively. These outcomes underscore the model's proficiency in identifying potential churners. Insights derived from this predictive model can guide tailored retention strategies, including personalized incentives and enhanced customer service initiatives.
